<p>Hi <?=$nameVar?>, </p>

<p>Congratulations to those of you who signed up for a membership at <b>Best Paying Surveys</b>. For those who don't know about Best Paying Surveys, here's what basically what it's about: it's an online course that tells you exactly how to make $4,000 a month from surveys, imcluding access to our complete list of 100+ Survey Partners - and our hacks and tricks to take surveys even if you don't qualify!</p>

<p>Here are some common questions that we get asked, and the answers to those questions.</p>


<p><b>How fast can I be paid?</b></p>

<p>This will depend on the survey company but many of them can pay within 24 hours, some will even pay you instantly! There are a few that will just mail you a check every few weeks or month but the majority pay much faster. Most programs have a $10 cashout minimum.</p>


<p><b>How will I get paid?</b></p>

<p>This really depends on what survey company you are working with as they offer a variety of rewards and payment options to compensate you for your time. The majority of surveys pay through Paypal, checks, gift cards, sweepstakes entries, and even merchandise. </p>
