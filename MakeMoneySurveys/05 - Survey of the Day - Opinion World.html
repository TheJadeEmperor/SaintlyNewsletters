<p>Hi **NAME**, </p>

<p><b>Opinion World</b> is a market research site that pays members for taking surveys. Opinion World doesn't offer traditional monetary compensation. Instead, you will be given points for the surveys you complete - about <u>100 points per paid survey</u> and once you receive 1000 points (which equals $10.00) you can cash out your account and either request a gift card from one of their retail partners, or you can withdraw the funds to a <b>PayPal</b> account.</p>
