<p>Hi **NAME**, </p>

<p><b>How much can I earn for watching videos?</b></p>

<p>Like many online earning opportunities, watching videos alone won’t make you rich, but it is a legit and easy way to put some extra bucks in your pocket. You’ll typically earn anywhere from a few cents to a dollar per view, depending on length. </p>

<p>With some programs, you might be asked for additional input after watching the video for a chance to earn even more.</p>

<p><b>What programs will pay for watching videos?</b></p>
<p>Below is a list of programs that feature paid video watching. They’re all legitimate programs with the same basic opportunities, so you can’t really go wrong with any of them.</p>

<p><b>What type of videos will I be watching?</b></p>
Getting paid to watch videos doesn't necessarily mean viewing a bunch of ads for fabric softener. There are some programs that will pay you to watch movie trailers, video game clips, and TV pilots that haven’t hit the air yet. Not too shabby.</p>

<p><b>Do I even have to watch the videos?</b></p>
<p>While some people try to cheat the system with multiple browser tabs all playing videos they’re not watching, programs are getting more sophisticated at detecting this nefarious behavior. We recommend keeping it on the level, so you don’t risk getting kicked out and losing your chance to earn in the future.</p>
