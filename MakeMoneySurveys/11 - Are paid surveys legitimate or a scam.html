<p>Hi <?=$nameVar?>,</p>

<p>Are paid surveys a scam? Can you <b>really</b> make money from surveys? There are many <a href="<?=$productLink?>" target="_BLANK">legitimate paid survey programs,</a> that let you supplement your income with cash and other rewards simply for sharing your opinion.</p>

<p>Just like the PTC industry, sometimes it can be difficult to tell the reputable players from the scammers. </p>

<p>Here are three obvious signs of a bad paid survey program:</p>
<p><?=$X_img?> Large payouts - if it looks too good to be true, it usually is. Be on the lookout for lavish rewards and huge sweepstakes.</p>

<p><?=$X_img?> The company's background is suspicious. If the owner is unknown that's a red flag. Try doing a whois search for the owner of the domain. If the owner is still not found, it means they're hiding something. </p>

<p><?=$X_img?> No privacy policy - all survey programs should have a clear privacy policy that explains how they plan to use your information. </p>

<p>Trust your instincts and do your research. Don't share your personal information with anyone unless you're 100% comfortable.</p>
