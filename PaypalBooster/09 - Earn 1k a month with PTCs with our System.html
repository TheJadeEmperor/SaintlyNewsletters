<p>Hi <?=$nameVar?>, </p>

<p>As you already know, ySense and is no longer a PTC site, but a GPT site. They have also removed their multi-level referral system and now have a 1 level referral system. After going through many changes, a lot of members have left the site. </p>

<center>
	<p>Despite that, I am still profiting from ySense. Look at my balance:</p>

	<p>Look at how many ySense referrals I have</p>
