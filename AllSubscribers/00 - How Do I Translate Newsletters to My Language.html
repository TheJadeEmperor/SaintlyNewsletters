<p>Hi <?=$nameVar?>, </p>
  
<p>In the past few weeks, many subscribers have asked me if they can receive newsletters in their language, whether it be French, Russian, Spanish, etc. </p>

<p>Because of the diversity of my audience, there is no way to send newsletters in so many languages. But thanks to Google Chrome, there is a way for you to receive emails in your language. </p>

<p><b>Step 1 - Download Chrome</b></p>

<p>This trick will only work with Chrome, so if you don't have it yet, you
can get it here: <br />

<p><a href="<?=$videoLink?>" target="_blank">How to translate emails to your language</a></p>

<p>Now you can use these steps whenever you receive a newsletter from me. In fact, you can now translate ANY website into your language!  </p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
