<p>Hi **NAME**,</p>

<p>I just wanted to wish you and your family a Happy New Year! 2019 is already over, and hopefully the year was productive and successful. But even if you have not hit all your goals, you can start over with 2020. May the new year bring you health and happiness, and success beyond your wildest dreams :) </p>

<p>Happy earnings!</p>
