<p>Hi **NAME**, </p>

<p>If you have ever done online shopping, then the honey app is a must for you. If you've never used it before, then you are missing out on potential savings on nearly every purchase. Honey is a chrome extension that you can easily download - after that you don't have to do anything. Just go shopping like you normally would and Honey will alert you if savings are available.</p>

<p>Honey will automatically try coupon codes until one of them works. If it does then you are saving money on your purchase. You can also get price drop alerts when the price of an item you want to buy drops. </p>

<p>Join honey through the link below

<p>Not only do you save money, but you can accumulate gold through each purchase you make. Once you get 1000 gold you can get a gift card at participating retailers. </p>

<p>Regards, </p>
