<p>Hi <?=$nameVar?>,</p>

<p>Ever since I started promoting 2captcha, many people have asked me many questions. So I put them all into a FAQ for your convenience. </p>

<p><b>Which is the minimal withdrawal amount?</b></p>

<p>0.50 USD to 1 USD, depending on which payment processor you use. </p>
<br />

<p><b>What payment methods do you use?</b></p>

<p>2captcha currently supports WebMoney, Payza, Perfect Money and Bitcoin.</p>
<br />

<p><b>I have requested a withdrawal. When am I going to get it?</b></p>

<p>They deliver payments on week days, once a day.</p>

<p><b>Will you add new payment methods?</b></p>

<p>Yes, they are coming soon. The only payment method they aren't interested in is transfering directly to credit cards - the commissions are simply too high.</p>
<br />

<p><b>Captchas are cheap and there are few of them.</b></p>

<p>The average fee for one solved Captcha varies. It depends on the number of Captchas that come to the service and the number of workers online. The fee goes down when there are many workers and few Captchas.</p>
<br />

<p><b>My referral has already earned 0.2 USD and I still did not get my referral commission. Why?</b></p>

<p>Affiliate earnings are distributed at night. Check your statistics tomorrow morning.</p>
<br /> 

<p><b>I have submitted two withdrawal requests on the same day. Which one will come to my purse first?</b></p>

<p>Payments are made once a day, every week day, in order of preference. If you have submitted two withdrawal requests, both will be processed at the same time.</p>
