<p>Hi ninja coder, </p>

<p><a href="https://www.pramp.com" target="_BLANK">Pramp</a> is a peer-to-peer platform that offers free, remote, and anonymous practice interviews for software engineers. It provides a unique experience where you can take the role of both interviewer and interviewee, giving you the opportunity to practice your coding and communication skills.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pramp.com" target="_BLANK">Pramp</a> offers two types of interviews: practice and mock interviews. Practice interviews are for warm-up and come with no feedback or scoring, while mock interviews are more formal and come with feedback and scoring from your peer interviewer.</p>

<p>As a user, you can also leave feedback for your peer interviewer and exchange contact information if you both agree. This feature allows for networking opportunities and potential job leads.</p>

<p>Overall, we find pramp to be an invaluable resource for your career. Job seekers who use pramp are 20% more likely to get the job offer than those who don't. </p>
