<p>Hi fellow ninja,</p>

<p>Ever since chatgpt came out, people have been going nuts over it because coders can use it to learn coding. I have used chatgpt for coding and it is absolutely amazing for learning a new programming language. </p>

<p>It can write an entire script for you in mere seconds, and explain the code to you, saving you time and headaches. Best of all, chatgpt is free to use. All you have to do is go to the openai website and register for a free account. </p>

<p>Then go to the chatgpt url and start chatting right away!</p>

<p>While chatgpt is extremely useful for coding, it will not do all the work for you. For example, chatgpt cannot help you fix bugs in a project with multiple files. It cannot read your entire repository so you are on your own. That's why full stack developers are still needed, and chatgpt will not be replacing anyone's job. </p>

<p>Also, chatgpt sometimes makes errors when including the latest versions of files, such as jquery. It is not always up to date so you will need to update the code yourself. </p>

<p>That's why it is crucial for a coder to learn coding the regular way. Our Full Stack Web Development Course teaches you to become a full stack developer.
