<p>Hi <?=$nameVar?>, </p>

<p>I thought I would fire off a quick email to let you know about an awesome pencil drawing course that a friend of mine has just released.</p>

<p>The course is a very comprehensive video series containing 13 lessons plus a heap of bonuses. Each lesson is two hours long so you can even draw with if you want. The first few lessons get you off to a flying start with all the basics being covered. You will be amazed at what you will be able to draw after even just these lessons.</p>

<p>From there you move on to portrait drawing. This is easily the most comprehensive portrait series I have ever seen. You not only learn all the basics (eye, mouth, etc.) like all the other courses do. This course goes way beyond that! You will learn how to draw the neck, cheeks, chins, beards, moustaches, hands, clothing, even hyper realistic portraits are covered.</p>

<p>What I really like about the course is that you aren't just shown how to draw each picture, Nolan actually explains his thinking behind what he is drawing. That allows you to draw for example ANY ear and not just the class ear.</p>

<p>The course is currently available at a huge discount - less than half price. I don't think the price is going to stay there for very long as it's way too cheap for what you get (32 hours of video lessons plus pdf downloads).</p>

<p>Go check it out before the introductory offer ends:</p>
