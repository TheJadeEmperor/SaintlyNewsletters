<p>Hi <?=$nameVar?>, </p>

<p>As you already know, Clixsense has become ySense and is no longer a PTC site, but a GPT site. But does that mean you can no longer profit from ySense? </p>

<p>Not true. Despite the disadvantages, ySense has changed its fee structure. They now let you earn 15% to 20% from your referral's earnings! This is the highest commission rate I've ever seen in a GPT site. </p>

<p>Here are some benefits of <a href="<?=$refLink?>">ySense</a>: </p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Established & paying site since 2007</li>
        <li>Earn 15% to 20% from referrals</li>
        <li>Get paid to do surveys, tasks, and offers</li>
        <li>Daily checklist bonus of up to 7%</li>
		<li>Browser add-on that helps you earn more money</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>In addition to all that, they have the ySense Addon, a browser extension that alerts you whenever new ads are available - so you don't miss out on anything!</p>

<p><a href="<?=$refLink?>">ySense</a> is still a profitable site. You can build a huge downline and earn 15%-20% commissions from their efforts. </p>

<p>See you on the other side!</p>
