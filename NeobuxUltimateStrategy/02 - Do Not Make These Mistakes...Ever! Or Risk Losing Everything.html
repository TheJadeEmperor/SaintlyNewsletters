<p>Hi <?=$nameVar?>, </p>

<p>Today we will cover some common pitfalls to avoid. Some of these will cause you to lose profits and time, and the last pitfall is the most important of all, might cause you to get banned forever.</p>


<p><?=$X_img?> &nbsp; <span style="font-size: 20px"><b>Getting direct referrals too early</b></span></p>

<p>This is a common newbie mistake. You can only have directs after you have been registered for 15 days and have 100 personal clicks. We recommend that you become familiar with Neobux's FAQ. You can't play the game if you don't know the rules.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><?=$X_img?> &nbsp; <span style="font-size: 20px"><b>Cashing out too early </b></span></p>

<p>This is another common pitfall, mostly with impatient people. In order to see if Neobux is legit, many people will earn $1.00 and then cash out. Great, you now have a whole dollar in your paypal account. That dollar should have been put towards renting referrals.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><?=$X_img?> &nbsp; <span style="font-size: 20px"><b>Skipping days / Quitting </b></span></p>

<p>A lot of people skip days of clicking on ads, especially in the beginning. Maybe they forgot to, or maybe they're just not motivated. Whatever the reason, skipping days will slow your progress, and 
your game plan to wealth is delayed. The solution to this is having proper motivation. Our newsletter will provide the motivation you need to stay active. The fact that you are reading this very newsletter 
is proof of your dedication! All you need to do is continue to do what you do. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><?=$X_img?> &nbsp; <span style="font-size: 20px"><b>Making more than 1 account per household</b></span></p>

<p>This is by far the most important pitfall to avoid. You will not believe how many subscribers have said to me they were banned because they accidentally made more than one account. You can only have 1 account per household or IP address. Neobux is very strict about this rule, so no matter what, do NOT make more than 1 account! </p>


<p>If you lost your password, contact the Neobux admin at <a target="_BLANK" href="mailto:tickets@neobux.com">tickets@neobux.com</a>. Do NOT make another account, otherwise, say goodbye to you account, as well as your earnings.</p>
