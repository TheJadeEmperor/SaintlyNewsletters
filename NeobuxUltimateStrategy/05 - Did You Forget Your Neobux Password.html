<p>Hi <?=$nameVar?>, </p>

<p>We often get asked for help by subscribers when they have trouble logging 
into their Neobux account. That's why today we are going to cover what steps
to take when you can't log in. </p>

<p><b>If you lost your password</b></p>

On the login screen, you will see a blue button that says "recover password" -
click on that button to be taken to the next screen. 

<p align="center"><img src="<?=$imgLink?>password1.jpg" border="1"></p>

Here, you need to enter your account username and your year of birth. Then,
enter the verification code and click on "Send" - then you will wait for an
email from Neobux support desk. 

<p align="center"><img src="<?=$imgLink?>password2.jpg" border="1"></p>

<p>They will generate a new password for you and send you an email that looks like the one
below. And that is all you have to do to recover your password. If you forgot your year
of birth however, then you cannot use this process. You will have to contact Neobux
directly and ask them to recover your accuont for you. Please contact them
at this address: <b><a href="mailto:support@neobux.com">support@neobux.com</a></b></p>

<p align="center"><img src="<?=$imgLink?>password3.jpg" border="1"></p>

Remember, it is your responsibility to remember usernames and passwords. We
suggest you keep all your accounts in a notepad file for easy reference. Whenever
you make a new account, make sure you update your passwords file. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>I got banned from Neobux!</b></p>

<p>This is another common scenario that happens - and it happens more often than 
you think. We feel your pain and sympathize with you, but if this happens to you,
you need to be prepared for the worst case scenario. </p>

<p>You need to be mentally prepared that you will never see your account again. 
 Neobux's banning policies are very strict. But, if you are innocent, then send 
 an email to Neobux support explaining what happened: 
<b><a href="mailto:tickets@neobux.com">tickets@neobux.com</a></b></p>


<p>I don't know how long it will take them to respond, if they respond at all. 
Just be patient and wait for their email. They may restore your account, they
may not, you need to be prepared for anything. </p>

	
<p><i>Take a deep breath and don't panic.</i> It's not the end of the world. 
Neobux is not the only money maker there is, you can join other PTC sites and
make money from them. That's why I recommend you remain active at 5-10 PTC sites
at all times, so even if you lose one account, you still have others. </p>
	
<p>Sincerely, </p>
