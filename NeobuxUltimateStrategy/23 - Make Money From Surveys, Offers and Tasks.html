<p>Hi <?=$nameVar?>, </p>

<p>As you already know, Clixsense has removed its PTC features due to them losing their Paypal account. Without Paypal and no ads to click on, Clixsense is no longer a PTC site, but a GPT site. But does that mean you can no longer profit from Clixsense? </p>

<center><p>Despite that, I am still profiting from Clixsense. Look at my balance:</p>

<p>Look at how many Clixsense referrals I have</p>

<p>As you can see, there's no better time to join Clixsense than now. You can get the Neobux Ultimate Strategy to find out how we continue to profit from Clixsense and other PTC sites.</p>
