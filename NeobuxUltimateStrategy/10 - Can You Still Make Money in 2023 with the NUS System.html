<p>Hi <?=$nameVar?>,</p>

<p>Some of you guys have asked me if the NUS still works in 2023. It's okay to be a little skpetical, because it shows that you're thinking for yourself. This is why we have put up an archive of all our payment screenshots that we've done throughout the years. </p>

<p>The archive is available through our blog: <br /><a href="<?=$archiveLink?>"><?=$archiveLink?></a></p>

<p>No matter what year it is, the strategy remains the same and stands the test of time. Go ahead and see our proof of referrals for yourself. </p>

<p>See you on the other side!</p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>
