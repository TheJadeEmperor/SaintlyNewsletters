<p>Hi <?=$nameVar?>, </p>

<p>What's so attractive about PTC's is that they make it seem so easy. to make money. However, because it seems so "easy", most people underestimate what they need to do, and end up failing. The ugly truth of the matter is, most people who join PTC's barely make any money, and those who've invested money come out at a loss. </p>

<p>And do you know the biggest reason they fail? </p>

<h4>No Direct Referrals</h4>

<p>That's right. Not all PTC's are created equal. But they all have one thing in common - you can earn money from direct referrals. But they are not that easy to get... you have to promote, promote, promote. And after all that work, you still didn't get any referrals.</p>

<h4>Why is Getting Direct Referrals So Hard? </h4>

<p>The answer is simple: they do not have a working strategy. They joined Neobux with unrealistic expectations, hoping to make it rich quick. But when they realize that it is not making money fast, they start to become frustrated and lose hope. If this is you right now, then you are at the right place - keep reading and don't miss a word.</p>
 
<p>What you need is a <b>working strategy</b> that shows you step by step how to effectively use PTC's. Unfortunately,
there is no such program out there that can help you.</p>

<p>But the good news is that the <a href="<?=$productLink?>">Neobux Ultimate Strategy Video Course</a> has been designed for 
those who want to make it big, but don't know how. 
</p>

<p>Here are some highlights of the NUS: </p>

<ul>
<li>
	<p><i>How to set up a PTC system that allows you to get referrals on auto-pilot, just set it and forget it! </i>	
	</p>
</li>
<li>
	<p><b>How to make yourself the authority to your subscribers, and have them hungry for your offers, practically begging to be your referrals</b></p>
</li>
<li>
	<p><i>A straightforward, affordable way to get your system going without "complicated" work - and you don't even need a website! </i></p>
</li>
<li>
	<p><b>A hidden trick that virtually no one knows about that can double your referral sign-ups instantly 
	</b></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This video course will show you step by step what to do to implement the strategies laid out in the NUS - so that you won't be lost or confused as to what to do to next. This video course could be the thing that will take your PTC business to the next level, so get your hands on it while it's still cheap (the price will increase soon due to high demand).  </p>



<p>The NUS comes in PDF format, but some people don't like reading a lot of text, they can only learn through audio and visual 
    presentations. That's why I put my best strategies into a video format, so that anyone can benefit from them. 
    These video tutorials are waiting for you to watch in the members area. </p>

<p>All you have to do is watch the videos and follow our simple step by step instructions - it's like having your own guide telling you what to do. No more being lost and confused with PTC's.  </p>

<p>Maybe you're in the category of people who won't purchase now, but will purchase it later. That's cool too. But the video course may increase in price very soon, so waiting may literally cost you money. </p>


<p>But, more importantly than the price, waiting may cost you money that you could be making with PTC's...right now. If you wait a month or two to get the course, you will miss out on the revenue that you could've made in those 2 months. </p>

<p>Wouldn't that be a shame? </p>

<p>Don't be in that category...be one of the action takers and take action today!

<p>See you on the other side. </p>

<p>Cheers. </p>
