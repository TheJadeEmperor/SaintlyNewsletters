<p>Hi <?=$nameVar?>,</p>

<p>Today we are going to cover some fundamentals of managing your Neobux account. Often times, people join Neobux with no game plan, and they have no idea what to do. There is so much to do that it can be confusing and daunting. That's why we are giving you the following pointers: 
</p>

<p><p><?=$X_img?> &nbsp; <span style="font-size: 20px"><b>The free way is the slow way</b></span></p>

<p>When I first got started Neobux, I looked at it as a way to make money without spending any money. That's great if you are a patient person, but the down side is that if you do not invest anything, <i>it will take a while for you to earn money</i>, especially with the low earnings for standard members. If you put in <b>even $5.00</b> and rent some referrals, you will get ahead of the game a lot faster than others. </p> 


<p><p><?=$X_img?> &nbsp; <span style="font-size: 20px"><b>Renting referrals</b></span></p>

<p>You should rent referrals as soon as they are available. To put it simply, the more referrals you have, the more money you will make. The most successful members have thousands of referrals they manage (even tens of thousands). You need to learn
the fundamentals of managing referrals, such as recycling and renewing. </p>

<p>If you want to know if you are profiting, Neobux has a color system for you. If a referral is red, you are losing money, if it is yellow, you are breaking even, and if it is green, you are profiting. </p>

<p>We have material written for you regarding managing referrals. You can read our blog posts or check out the Neobux Basics ebook. </p>


<p><p><?=$X_img?> &nbsp; <span style="font-size: 20px"><b>Get Direct Referrals </b></span></p>

<p>Direct referrals are free to keep, and they make you money every day, so you should get as many as you can, until you get the max number, according to your membership level. Just like rented referrals, direct referrals need to be replaced
if they are not active. </p>

<p>However, for most people, finding direct referrals is a challenge. The Neobux Ultimate Strategy is a course that will teach you how to get direct referrals forever, and you will never run out! </p>


<p><p><?=$X_img?> &nbsp; <span style="font-size: 20px"><b>Prepare for Golden Membership</b></span></p>

<p>The Golden Membership will be your first major upgrade, so you will need to prepare for it from the beginning. Do not upgrade until you've had at least 300 rented referrals. When you are Golden, you can only rent at certain times of the
day, thus making it much harder for you. </p>

<p>Upgrade only when you have $120 in your balance. The Golden upgrade costs $90 and the $30 goes towards account management. </p>


<p><?=$X_img?> &nbsp; <span style="font-size: 20px"><b>Cashing Out</span></b></p>

<p>Finally, the part we've been working for. Once you have a clicking army, you will be profiting. Make sure you save enough money for rental fees and such. If you'd like, you can save some money for future upgrades (to ultimate). You may only cashout once per week, so factor that in your math. <i>Have fun earning!</i></p>
