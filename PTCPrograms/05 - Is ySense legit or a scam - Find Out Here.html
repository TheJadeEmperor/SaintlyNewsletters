<p>Hi <?=$nameVar?>, </p>

<p><a href="<?=$csLink?>">ySense</a> is one of the most reliable paying programs out there, second only to Neobux. To make some serious money from ySense, however, you need the right strategy, otherwise, this can be a slow earner. </p>

<p><b>Step 1 - Get the ySense Browser Add-on</b></p>

<p>Available for all major browsers, the ySense Addon lets you know when new offers or surveys are available. It also shows you your balance all in one box. If you are serious about earning money with ySense, you need to get the ySense.</p>

<p><b>Step 2 - Log in everyday</b></p>

<p>ySense is one of the few GPT's that reward you for being active daily. They have something called the Daily Checklist - do a few tasks and collect a 7% bonus on top of what you're earning. If you complete the Daily Checklist 3 days in a row, you will be rewarded even more. It really does pay to stay active and consistent. </p>

<p>The Daily Checklist is available in your account summary. Just click below to go to your account summary: <br />
